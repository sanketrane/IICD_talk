- RTES are only source of novel TCRs within the T cell compartment and therefore understanding their dynamics is crucial for understanding how TCR repertoires evolve across our lifespans.

- no way to identify RTEs phenotypically -- {ASM allows us to identify RTEs and therefore ca predict their dynamics.}

- RTEs distinct dynamics than mN?

Naive CD4 and CD8 T cell numbers increase rapidly early in life, peak around 8 weeks of age and decline slowly thereafter $(t_{1/2} \sim 160d)$.

In humans, the thymic contribution to naive T cell maintenance diminishes significantly post thymic-involution (puberty) as compared to in mice.

???
- The rules of T cell homeostasis differe in adults and elderly.

- Thymic counts and peripheral counts.

- thymic cellularity increases dramatically over short period of time.
- in periphery naive T cell dyamics are closely mapped onto thymic SP counts. thymic influx haevily dominates naive T cell homeostasis early on in life.

##  .center[How are T cell pools established early on in life?]
<hr>

</br>

### Thymic cellularity increases dramatically within first 7-8 weeks of age.
- Rapid influx of new naive T cells into the growing T cell compartments.

--

</br>

### Lymphopenia induced proliferation (LIP) -  naive T cells divide rapidly in empty niches.

- In neonates T cell niches are still delveloping. **Is there space for expansion?**

- Skewing of TCR repertoire? T cells coming out early on in life are over-represented. Is it uniform? Or inherent variation?


???
- Force of recruitment into memory early on in life?

### Do naive T cell dynamics differ between neonates and adults?
- Compensatory increase in cell division? or decrease in loss? or both?

???
naive T cell numbers are maintained stably till very late in life.

--

### Cell-age dependence &mdash;

- Naive T cells' persistance (division - loss) in mice and humans increases gradually with their age (time since thymic exit).

- Consequences on TCR repertoire diversity?

- Can it explain naive T cell development in dynamic neonatal niches?

### Mechanisms that regulate T cell pool sizes across our lifespans.
- **A model that explains it all** &xrarr; Dynamism in neonates and stability in adults. 

--

### TCR Repertoire diversity.
- How clonal populations establish and evolve? &xrarr; Simulating their dynamics.

--

### Recovery of T cell pools upon depletion.

- How naive T cell pools are restored and restablished upon T cell depletion (e.g. in HSC Transplants and in HIV patients)?

???
- Is there LIP? Does the extent of reconstitution depend on the age of individual?
